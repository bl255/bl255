Hi, I am Martina. I am a Python enthusiast. My projects include the Tic-Tac-Toe game in python Tkinter GUI, an script using Beautiful Soup to scrape data from an elections site and more. I am fan of Advent of Code. So far I could solve first 10 days of years I tried comfortably but the rest is a challenge I hope to tackle soon. Apart from that, I also prefer black tea to coffee ðŸ«–.
