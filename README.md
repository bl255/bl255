Hi, I am Martina. I am a Python enthusiast at the moment looking for an entry position in programming. My projects include the Tic-Tac-Toe game in python Tkinter GUI, an script using Beautiful Soup to scrape data from an elections site and more. I am also fan of Advent of Code. Apart from that, I prefer black tea to coffee ðŸ«–.
